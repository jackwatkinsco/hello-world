Hello.

Jack Watkins / creative, living in the UK and working around the globe.

Active in every aspect of the artistic process, I take projects from initial idea through to launch and evolution. My multi-disciplinary skills include music production, graphic design, web design and development, photography and video.

At present, I oversee the creative direction and artist development for musicians across a wide range of genres, whilst also leading on digital design and front end development for Kukri Sports.
